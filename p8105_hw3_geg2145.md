# Problem 1

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
```

The goal is to do some exploration of this dataset. To that end, write a
short description of the dataset, noting the size and structure of the
data, describing some key variables, and giving illustrative examples of
observations. Then, do or answer the following (commenting on the
results of each):

How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items ordered
from?

``` r
instacart %>%
  group_by(aisle) %>%
  summarize(items_ordered = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(items_ordered)) %>% 
  head(4)
```

    ## # A tibble: 4 × 2
    ##   aisle                      items_ordered
    ##   <chr>                              <int>
    ## 1 fresh vegetables                  150609
    ## 2 fresh fruits                      150473
    ## 3 packaged vegetables fruits         78493
    ## 4 yogurt                             55240

Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle,
limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered. Arrange
aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.

``` r
instacart %>%
  group_by(aisle) %>%
  summarize(items_ordered = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(items_ordered)) %>%
  filter(items_ordered > 10000) %>%
  mutate(aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, items_ordered)) %>%
  ggplot() + geom_point(aes(x = aisle, y = items_ordered)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the aisles
“baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables fruits”.
Include the number of times each item is ordered in your table.

``` r
instacart %>%
  filter(aisle == "baking ingredients" | 
         aisle == "dog food care" |
         aisle == "packaged vegetables fruits") %>%
  group_by(aisle, product_name) %>%
  summarize(times_ordered = n()) %>%
  mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(times_ordered))) %>%
  filter(rank <= 3) %>%
  arrange(aisle, rank) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'aisle'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

| aisle                      | product_name                                  | times_ordered | rank |
|:---------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|--------------:|-----:|
| baking ingredients         | Light Brown Sugar                             |           499 |    1 |
| baking ingredients         | Pure Baking Soda                              |           387 |    2 |
| baking ingredients         | Cane Sugar                                    |           336 |    3 |
| dog food care              | Snack Sticks Chicken & Rice Recipe Dog Treats |            30 |    1 |
| dog food care              | Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe           |            28 |    2 |
| dog food care              | Small Dog Biscuits                            |            26 |    3 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach                          |          9784 |    1 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries                           |          5546 |    2 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries                           |          4966 |    3 |

Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady Apples
and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week; format this
table for human readers (i.e. produce a 2 x 7 table).

``` r
instacart %>%
  filter(product_name == "Pink Lady Apples" | 
         product_name == "Coffee Ice Cream") %>%
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>%
  summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = order_dow, 
              values_from = mean_hour) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'product_name'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

| product_name     |        0 |        1 |        2 |        3 |        4 |        5 |        6 |
|:-----------------|---------:|---------:|---------:|---------:|---------:|---------:|---------:|
| Coffee Ice Cream | 13.77419 | 14.31579 | 15.38095 | 15.31818 | 15.21739 | 12.26316 | 13.83333 |
| Pink Lady Apples | 13.44118 | 11.36000 | 11.70213 | 14.25000 | 11.55172 | 12.78431 | 11.93750 |

# Problem 2

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("brfss_smart2010")
```

First, do some data cleaning:

- format the data to use appropriate variable names;
- focus on the “Overall Health” topic
- include only responses from “Excellent” to “Poor”
- organize responses as a factor taking levels ordered from “Poor” to
  “Excellent”

Using this dataset, do or answer the following (commenting on the
results of each):

    In 2002, which states were observed at 7 or more locations? What about in 2010?
    Construct a dataset that is limited to Excellent responses, and contains, year, state, and a variable that averages the data_value across locations within a state. Make a “spaghetti” plot of this average value over time within a state (that is, make a plot showing a line for each state across years – the geom_line geometry and group aesthetic will help).
    Make a two-panel plot showing, for the years 2006, and 2010, distribution of data_value for responses (“Poor” to “Excellent”) among locations in NY State.
