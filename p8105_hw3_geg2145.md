**The dataset has 1384617 rows and 15 variables, where every row is a
product ordered. Every product ordered has an `order_id` (it is possible
for multiple products to be bought as part of the same order) a
`product_name` and an `aisle` name. We can also see the day of the week
and hour the order was processed (`order_dow` and `order_hour_of_day`,
respectively).**

How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items ordered
from?

``` r
instacart %>%
  group_by(aisle) %>%
  summarize(items_ordered = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(items_ordered)) %>% 
  head(4)
```

    ## # A tibble: 4 × 2
    ##   aisle                      items_ordered
    ##   <chr>                              <int>
    ## 1 fresh vegetables                  150609
    ## 2 fresh fruits                      150473
    ## 3 packaged vegetables fruits         78493
    ## 4 yogurt                             55240

**There are 134 different aisles, with most of the orders being in the
“fresh vegetables”, “fresh fruits”, “packaged vegetables fruits” and
“yogurt” aisles.**

Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle,
limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered. Arrange
aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.

``` r
instacart %>%
  group_by(aisle) %>%
  summarize(items_ordered = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(items_ordered)) %>%
  filter(items_ordered > 10000) %>%
  mutate(aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, items_ordered)) %>%
  ggplot() + geom_point(aes(x = aisle, y = items_ordered)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  labs(title= "Best selling aisles sell food and perishables",
       x="Aisle", "Items Ordered")
```

![](p8105_hw3_geg2145_files/figure-gfm/p1_plot-1.png)<!-- -->

**We can also see here how most of the orders are from the “fresh
vegetables”, “fresh fruits”, “packaged vegetables fruits” and “yogurt”
aisles. We can also see “butter”, “oils and vinegars” and “dry pasta”
are the aisles least bought from. We also see how most of the aisles
(about two thirds) have less than 20,000 orders, and then the number of
orders increases exponentially. The aisles with the most orders usually
hold food that is consumed often (like water) and/or goes bad easily
(like milk).**

Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the aisles
“baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables fruits”.
Include the number of times each item is ordered in your table.

``` r
instacart %>%
  filter(aisle == "baking ingredients" | 
         aisle == "dog food care" |
         aisle == "packaged vegetables fruits") %>%
  group_by(aisle, product_name) %>%
  summarize(times_ordered = n()) %>%
  mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(times_ordered))) %>%
  filter(rank <= 3) %>%
  arrange(aisle, rank) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'aisle'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

| aisle                      | product_name                                  | times_ordered | rank |

| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries                           |          4966 |    3 |

**The best selling baking ingredient is light brown sugar, while the
best selling packaged vegetables and fruits is organic baby spinach. The
three highest selling dog food care times have similar order counts.**

Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady Apples
and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week; format this
table for human readers (i.e. produce a 2 x 7 table).

``` r
instacart %>%
  filter(product_name == "Pink Lady Apples" | 
         product_name == "Coffee Ice Cream") %>%
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>%
  summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = order_dow, 
              values_from = mean_hour) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'product_name'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

**Coffee Ice Cream is bought in the afternoon (around lunchtime)
regardless of the day, while pink lady apples are bought before noon on
Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.**

# Problem 2

``` r
data("brfss_smart2010")
```

First, do some data cleaning:

- format the data to use appropriate variable names;
- focus on the “Overall Health” topic
- include only responses from “Excellent” to “Poor”
- organize responses as a factor taking levels ordered from “Poor” to
  “Excellent”

``` r
brfss_smart2010 = brfss_smart2010 %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  filter(topic == "Overall Health" &
           !is.na(response)) %>%
  mutate(response = factor(response, levels = c("Poor", "Fair", "Good", 
                                "Very good", "Excellent")))
```

Using this dataset, do or answer the following (commenting on the
results of each):

- In 2002, which states were observed at 7 or more locations? What about
  in 2010?

``` r
brfss_smart2010 %>%
  filter(year == 2002) %>%
  group_by(locationabbr) %>%
  summarize(unique_locations = length(unique(locationdesc))) %>%
  filter(unique_locations >= 7) %>%
  knitr::kable(caption = "States observed at 7 or more locations in 2002")
```

| locationabbr | unique_locations |
|:-------------|-----------------:|
| CT           |                7 |
| FL           |                7 |
| MA           |                8 |
| NC           |                7 |
| NJ           |                8 |
| PA           |               10 |

States observed at 7 or more locations in 2002

``` r
brfss_smart2010 %>%
  filter(year == 2010) %>%
  group_by(locationabbr) %>%
  summarize(unique_locations = length(unique(locationdesc))) %>%
  filter(unique_locations >= 7)%>%
  knitr::kable(caption = "States observed at 7 or more locations in 2010")
```

| locationabbr | unique_locations |
|:-------------|-----------------:|
| CA           |               12 |
| CO           |                7 |
| FL           |               41 |
| MA           |                9 |

| NC           |               12 |
| NE           |               10 |
| NJ           |               19 |
| NY           |                9 |
| OH           |                8 |
| PA           |                7 |
| SC           |                7 |
| TX           |               16 |
| WA           |               10 |

States observed at 7 or more locations in 2010

**While only 6 states where observed in seven or more locations in 2002
(Connecticut, Florida, Massachusetts, North Carolina, New Jersey and
Pennsylvania), 14 states did the same in 2010 (including the same 6 that
completed the feature in 2002).**

- Construct a dataset that is limited to Excellent responses, and
  contains, year, state, and a variable that averages the data_value
  across locations within a state. Make a “spaghetti” plot of this
  average value over time within a state (that is, make a plot showing a
  line for each state across years – the geom_line geometry and group
  aesthetic will help).

``` r
brfss_smart2010 %>% 
  filter(response == "Excellent") %>%
  group_by(year, locationabbr) %>%
  summarize(mean_value = mean(data_value))  %>%
  arrange(desc(year)) %>%
  ggplot() + geom_line(aes(x = year, y = mean_value,
                            group = locationabbr)) +
  labs(y = "Mean values across locations", x= "Year", 
       title = "There is a decrease in value between 2002 and 2005 before stabilizing")
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'year'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

    ## Warning: Removed 3 rows containing missing values (`geom_line()`).

![](p8105_hw3_geg2145_files/figure-gfm/p2_spaghetti_plot-1.png)<!-- -->

**The general trend for all states is that the mean value across
locations decreased from 2002 to 2005, but then stabilized from then to
2010.**

- Make a two-panel plot showing, for the years 2006, and 2010,
  distribution of data_value for responses (“Poor” to “Excellent”) among
  locations in NY State.

``` r
brfss_smart2010 %>%
  filter(locationabbr == "NY" & (year == 2006 | year == 2010))  %>%
  mutate(year = factor(year, levels = c("2006", "2010")))  %>%
  ggplot() + geom_density(aes(x = data_value, fill = response), alpha= 0.5) +
  facet_grid( ~ year) + 
  labs(x= "Value", y = "Density", 
       title = "Distribution of values in 2006 and 2010 was very similar", 
       fill = "Response")
```

![](p8105_hw3_geg2145_files/figure-gfm/p2_NY_plot-1.png)<!-- -->

**In both 2006 and 2010, the lowest values correspond to “Poor”
responses, while “Fair” and “Excellent” responses follow. In both years,
“Good” and “Very Good” responses follow. In 2010, there are less “Poor”
responses than in 2006.**

# Problem 3

Load, tidy, merge, and otherwise organize the data sets. Your final
dataset should include all originally observed variables; exclude
participants less than 21 years of age, and those with missing
demographic data; and encode data with reasonable variable classes
(i.e. not numeric, and using factors with the ordering of tables and
plots in mind).

``` r
df_dem = read_csv(file = "./data/nhanes_covar.csv",
                  skip = 4) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%

  filter(age > 20) %>%
  mutate(sex = case_when(
    sex == 1 ~ "male",
    sex == 2 ~ "female"),
    education = case_when(
      education == 1 ~ "Less than high school",
      education == 2 ~ "High school equivalent",
      education == 3 ~ "More than high school"
    )) %>%
  mutate(sex = factor(sex),
         education = factor(education, levels = c("Less than high school",
                                                  "High school equivalent",
                                                  "More than high school")))

Produce a reader-friendly table for the number of men and women in each
education category, and create a visualization of the age distributions
for men and women in each education category. Comment on these items.

``` r
df_dem %>%

  summarize(count = n()) %>%
  knitr::kable()

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'sex'. You can override using the `.groups`
    ## argument.

| sex    | education              | count |
|:-------|:-----------------------|------:|
| female | Less than high school  |    28 |
| female | High school equivalent |    23 |

| male   | Less than high school  |    27 |
| male   | High school equivalent |    35 |

  ggplot() + geom_bar(aes(x = education, fill = sex)) + 
  labs(y = "Count", x = "Education", 
       title = "Most of the subjects have more than high school education",
       subtitle = "Males and females are evenly distributed in two of the three education levels")
```

![](p8105_hw3_geg2145_files/figure-gfm/p3_sex_education-1.png)<!-- -->

**We can see from the bar plot that most of the subjects in the study
had more than a high school education (about 50% of the study). Although
the distribution of sex in the groups of “less than high school” and
“more than high school” education is pretty much even, the study had
twelve more males with a “high school equivalent” than females with the
same level of education.**

Traditional analyses of accelerometer data focus on the total activity
over the day. Using your tidied dataset, aggregate across minutes to
create a total activity variable for each participant. Plot these total
activities (y-axis) against age (x-axis); your plot should compare men
to women and have separate panels for each education level. Include a
trend line or a smooth to illustrate differences. Comment on your plot.

``` r
df_mims %>%
  group_by(seqn, education, age, sex) %>%
  summarize(total_activity = sum (mims)) %>%
  ggplot() + geom_point(aes(y = total_activity, x = age, 
                            color = sex), alpha = .5) +
  geom_smooth(aes(y = total_activity, x = age,

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'seqn', 'education', 'age'. You can
    ## override using the `.groups` argument.
    ## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula = 'y ~ x'

![](p8105_hw3_geg2145_files/figure-gfm/p3_age_activity_plot-1.png)<!-- -->

**In this plot, we see that female subjects had higher activity levels
regardless of age when the subjects had either a high school education,
or higher. This includes a very high difference between female and male
subjects with a high school education and at around 40 years of age, and
among those 60 years of age and with a level of education greater than
high school. This trend is not true for subjects with less than high
school, where males seemed to be more active. In general, those with an
education greater than high school had constant activity levels, across
age values, while the other education levels showed a steeper decline
once subjects got to an older age.**

Accelerometer data allows the inspection activity over the course of the
day. Make a three-panel plot that shows the 24-hour activity time
courses for each education level and use color to indicate sex. Describe
in words any patterns or conclusions you can make based on this graph;
including smooth trends may help identify differences.

``` r
df_mims %>%
  ggplot() + geom_point(aes(y = mims, x = minute, 
                            color = sex), alpha = .05, size = 0.5)+
  geom_smooth(aes(y = mims, x = minute,

![](p8105_hw3_geg2145_files/figure-gfm/p3_24hr_plot-1.png)<!-- -->

**In the plot, we can see that the subjects exhibited similar activity
levels regardless of their level of education or sex: almost no activity
at around 4 am, with most activity starting at around 5 am and the peak
activity time being the usual 8 am to 8 pm. The biggest difference
(albeit small) difference can be seen between female and male subjects
with an education level greater than high school, where female subjects
remained more active than male subjects throughout the day (on similar
trends).**
